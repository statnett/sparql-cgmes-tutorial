# Introduction to SPARQL and CGMES/CIM

This is a hands-on course in SPARQL with a focus on crafting queries for data following the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) format.
CGMES is an extension of the common information model (CIM) for electrical systems, and is an information model that specifies how power grids should be modelled.

CGMES data is commonly stored as *RDF-XML* files, which can be queried with something called SPARQL.
At first glance, this can seem quite confusing, but after working through this course, you will hopefully feel confident in craftin simple queryies for exploring such data.

This is a hands-on course, and you should be able to follow along on your own.
However, be aware that many of the exercises will ask you to do stuff that you aren't familiar with yet.
The reason for this is that you learn best if you figure it out yourself, so if you're stuck at a problem, then you can move on and read the explanations afterwards.

Also, many of the exercises will ask you to discuss with a neighbour.
It is highly recommended that you work through these exercises with a colleague, but if you can't then just reflect on those questions by yourself.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you will need a computer with uv installed.
